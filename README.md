# Robotic-Arm-Pick-and-Place-Simulation
 
The Robotic Arm Pick-and-Place Simulation project which is combining both RoboDK and MATLAB to automate a manufacturing task. It Simulated a robotic arm performing a pick-and-place task in a manufacturing line using RoboDK. Along with that Developed a complete trajectory planning, including waypoints and velocity profiles. And Implemented Forward and Inverse Kinematics using MATLAB Robotics Toolbox to verify the robotic arm’s movement and accuracy.
 
1. Picks a disk from Station 1
2. Moves the disk to Station 2 for labeling.
3. Places the disk at Station 3 for transfer to another.
   **Tools Used:**
   RoboDK: To simulate the robotic arm's motion.
   MATLAB: For trajectory planning, forward and inverse kinematics, and velocity profile generation.
 
   **Running the MATLAB Code**
Clone this repository
 
Open the RoboDK project files.
 
Set up the robotic arm and station environment as described in the task.
 
Run the simulation to visualize the pick-and-place operation.
 
Run trajectory_planning.m to simulate the arm’s motion and generate kinematic analysis.
